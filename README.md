# Skill Test Update

## Note on Test Update

The test `testHasFunctionExists()` currently checks for methods that start with `has` instead of the required `has_` prefix, as specified in the description. 

To align with the given requirements, the function name in the test should be updated to start with `has_` (i.e., `$function = 'has_' . $this->generateRandomString(5);`). Alternatively, if the logic in the `Skill.php` class is adjusted to work with `has_`, the test would work as intended.

Changing either the test or the class to be consistent is necessary for the unit tests to pass and meet the requirements. 

**Update made:**  
I've updated `testHasFunctionExists()` to change `"has"` to `"has_"` in `SkillTest.php` to ensure consistency with the required prefix.

**Instructions to Run:**
After installing PHPUnit 9.5 with PHP 8.1, run the following command in the terminal:

```bash
vendor/bin/phpunit --bootstrap vendor/autoload.php tests/SkillTest.php
